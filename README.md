A Machine Learning–Powered SMS Spam Classification Project

# 🚀 Project Overview
- SMSGuard is an advanced SMS spam detection system built using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
It analyzes text messages and predicts whether they are Spam or Ham (Genuine) using TF-IDF vectorization and multiple ML models like:
- 🔹 Naive Bayes
- 🔹 Logistic Regression
- 🔹 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
: The project includes custom SMS prediction, confusion matrix visualization, and real-world testing, making it ideal for cybersecurity, telecom filtering, and academic ML demonstration.

# 🧠 Key Features
✔️ Data Preprocessing
- Label encoding (spam = 1, ham = 0)
- Train-test split
- TF-IDF vectorization

✔️ Machine Learning Models
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (Linear Kernel)

✔️ Evaluation
Classification report
Accuracy comparison
Confusion matrix heatmap

✔️ Real-World Testing
10 real SMS samples tested with model predictions.

✔️ Custom Prediction
User can input any SMS to classify instantaneously.

# 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python 🐍
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Jupyter Notebook

# 📊 Model Training & Results
- *Three models were trained and evaluated*:
  
**Model	Description**
- Naive Bayes	Fast, good for text classification
- Logistic Regression	Strong baseline ML model
- SVM (Linear)	Best accuracy & performance
: The SVM model performed best and was selected for final deployment.

# 🧪 10 Realistic SMS Test Samples
The project tests the classifier using real-world styled examples including:
- Lottery fraud messages
- Bank/KYC phishing URLs
- Safe messages from family/friends
- Fake reward & cashback links
: This ensures the model performs effectively in real scenarios.

# 🧩 Confusion Matrix
A heatmap visualization helps observe:
- True Positives
- True Negatives
- False Positives
- False Negatives

# 📝 How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Install Required Libraries
